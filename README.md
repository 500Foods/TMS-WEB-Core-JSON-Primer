# TMS-WEB-Core-JSON-Primer

This repository contains various code samples that first appeared in TMS Blog posts about using JSON within
TMS WEB Core. The original posts can be found at (part 1) https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=928
and (part 2) https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=932 and were originally posted on May 5th and 6th, 2022.

This repository contains the source code for each of the Examples along with any subsequent updates or improvements.  
This currently consists of Examples 2-31. These can be found in the /Combined folder.  

The /Delphi, /JavaScript and /TMS WEB Core folders contain simplified versions of Examples 2-24, where only the
specific variation is included, in an effort to simplify the code for those interested in just one variation.

If you have ideas for improvements to any of the Examples or would like some examples of other functionality
using JSON within TMS WEB Core projects, or if you find issues with any of the examples posted, by all means please
post an Issue or a Discussion item.

If you find this repository useful to your work or that it has saved you time or effort when it comes to crafting
a better TMS WEB Core project, please consider https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andrewsimard500.

Enjoy!
