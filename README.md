# TMS-WEB-Core-JSON-Primer

This repository contains various code samples that first appeared in TMS Blog posts about using JSON within
TMS WEB Core. The original posts can be found at (part 1) https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=928
and (part 2) https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=932 and were originally posted on May 5th and 6th, 2022.

This repository contains the source code examples along with any subsequent updates or improvements.  Originally,
there were 30+ examples, with each containing code for three different coding environents. The first is referred to
as JS for pure JavaScript, where examples will work in any JavaScript environment.  The second is referred to as WC 
and uses the TMS WEB Core-supplied wrappers and a base type of TJSObject for its examples.  And finally, the PAS
variant uses pure Delphi and TJSONObject as its base type and should work in any Delphi project, whether or not 
TMS WEB Core is involved, though the intent is to give examples that will work in a TMS XData application.

The repository also has these three environments split out into their own individual folders, so if you're only
interested in one environment, you don't need to be bogged down with the other two, although all three are wrapped
in a Delphi function which isn't strictly necessary in the case of JavaScript.

If you have some ideas for improvements to any of the examples or would like some examples of other functionality
using JSON within TMS WEB Core projects, or if you find issues with any of the examples posted, by all means please
post an Issue or a Discussion item.

If you find this repository useful to your work and that it has saved you time or effort when it comes to crafting
a better TMS WEB Core project, please consider https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andrewsimard500.
